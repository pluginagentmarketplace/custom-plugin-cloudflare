# Core Development Paths

## Frontend Development
**Timeline:** 3-6 months | **Stack:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript + React/Vue/Angular

```
HTML5 & CSS3 → JavaScript ES6+ → Framework → State Management → Testing → Deployment
```

**Key Skills:** DOM, Components, Hooks, Routing, State, API Integration, Testing, Performance

**Projects:** Todo App → Weather App → E-commerce UI → Real-time Chat

---

## Backend Development
**Timeline:** 6-12 months | **Stack:** Language + Framework + Database + API

```
Language Fundamentals → Web Framework → Database → API Design → Testing → DevOps
```

**Key Skills:** Server Architecture, Databases, Authentication, API Design, Testing, Deployment

**Recommended Stack:** Python/FastAPI or Node.js/NestJS + PostgreSQL

---

## Full Stack Development
**Timeline:** 6+ months | **Stack:** Frontend + Backend + Database

```
Frontend Mastery → Backend Mastery → Integration → DevOps → Scaling
```

**Best Start:** Next.js (Full-stack React) + PostgreSQL + Vercel

**Key Learning:** End-to-end application development, DevOps basics, system thinking

---

## DevOps Engineering
**Timeline:** 1-2 years | **Stack:** Linux + Docker + Kubernetes + Cloud + IaC

```
Linux & Bash → Docker → Kubernetes → Cloud Platform (AWS/GCP/Azure) → Terraform → Monitoring
```

**Key Skills:** System Admin, Containerization, Orchestration, IaC, CI/CD, Monitoring

**Requires:** Prior development or system admin experience

---

## Technology Stack Recommendations

| Path | Recommended | Alternative | Timeline |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Frontend** | React/TypeScript | Vue, Angular | 3-6 mo |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + PostgreSQL | NestJS + PG, Go | 6-12 mo |
| **Full Stack** | Next.js + PostgreSQL | SvelteKit, Remix | 6+ mo |
| **DevOps** | Docker + K8s + Terraform | Cloud-native tools | 1-2 yrs |

---

## Learning Progression

**Months 1-3:** Learn fundamentals deeply (language, basics)
**Months 3-6:** Build 2-3 projects (portfolio building)
**Months 6-9:** Deep dive into specialization
