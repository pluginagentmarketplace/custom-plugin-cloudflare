# Mobile & Games

## Mobile Development Paths

### iOS Development (Swift)
**Timeline:** 6-9 months | **Stack:** Swift + SwiftUI + Xcode

```
Swift Basics → SwiftUI → Navigation → Data Persistence → APIs → Testing → App Store
```

**Key:** Declarative UI, State management, Core Data, URLSession

---

### Android Development (Kotlin)
**Timeline:** 6-9 months | **Stack:** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Android Studio

```
Kotlin Basics → Jetpack Compose → Navigation → Room DB → Coroutines → Testing → Play Store
```

**Key:** Null safety, Coroutines, MVVM, Compose

---

### Cross-Platform (Flutter)
**Timeline:** 4-6 months | **Stack:** Dart + Flutter

```
Dart Basics → Flutter Widgets → State Management → APIs → Firebase → Deployment
```

**Pros:** Single codebase, Near-native performance, Hot reload
**Best For:** Rapid development, iOS + Android simultaneously

---

## Game Development

### Choose Engine

| Engine | Best For | Market Share | Learning | Performance |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Unity** | 2D/3D, Multi-platform | 51% | Medium | Good |
| **Unreal** | AAA, High-fidelity | 31% | Hard | Excellent |

---

### Game Development Path

**Timeline:** 1-2 years

```
Game Basics → Architecture (ECS) → Physics → Graphics → Audio → Networking → Polish → Publish
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Game Loop (Update → Render)
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Physics & Collisions
- Asset Management
- Performance Optimization

---

## Technology Comparison

| Platform | Framework | Code Share | Performance | Learning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| iOS | SwiftUI | - | Native | ⭐⭐ |
| Android | Compose | - | Native | ⭐⭐ |
| Cross-Plat | Flutter | 95%+ | Native | ⭐⭐ |
| Games | Unity | - | Good | ⭐⭐⭐ |

---

## Mobile Stack Recommendations

**iOS:** Swift + SwiftUI + Core Data + Xcode

**Android:** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose + Room + AS

**Cross-Platform:** Flutter + Dart + Firebase

**Games:** Unity + C# or Unreal + C++

---

## Mobile Development Best Practices

- Start with one platform (iOS or Android)
- Master native first, then cross-platform
- Performance optimization critical
- Test on real devices
- Publish to App Store/Play Store

---

## Portfolio Projects

**Mobile:** Todo App → Weather App → Social App → Payment App
**Games:** 2D Game → 3D Game → Multiplayer Game
