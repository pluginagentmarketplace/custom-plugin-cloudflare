# Mobile & Game Development

## Mobile Platforms

| Platform | Framework | Language | Timeline | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **iOS** | SwiftUI | Swift | 6-9 mo | Apple apps |
| **Android** | Jetpack Compose | Kotlin | 6-9 mo | Android apps |
| **Cross-Plat** | Flutter | Dart | 4-6 mo | Both platforms |
| **Cross-Plat** | React Native | JavaScript | 4-6 mo | JS devs |

---

## iOS Development Path

```
Swift Basics → SwiftUI → Navigation → Data Persistence → APIs → Testing → App Store
```

**Key:** Declarative UI, State management, Core Data, URLSession

---

## Android Development Path

```
Kotlin Basics → Jetpack Compose → Navigation → Room DB → Coroutines → Play Store
```

**Key:** Null safety, Coroutines, MVVM pattern, Testing

---

## Cross-Platform: Flutter

```
Dart Basics → Widgets → State Management → APIs → Firebase → Deploy
```

**Advantages:** Single codebase (95%+), native performance, hot reload

**Timeline:** 4-6 months

---

## Game Development

### Choose Engine

**Unity (51% market share):**
- Best for: 2D, 3D, multi-platform
- Language: C#
- Learning: Medium
- Best for: Indie games, rapid dev

**Unreal Engine (31% success rate):**
- Best for: AAA, high-fidelity
- Language: C++, Blueprints
- Learning: Hard
- Best for: Large studios

---

## Game Development Path

```
Game Loop → Architecture (ECS) → Physics → Graphics → Audio → Networking → Polish
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 years to junior game dev

---

## Mobile Stack Selection

**iOS:** Swift + SwiftUI + Core Data + Xcode

**Android:** Kotlin + Compose + Room + Android Studio

**Cross-Platform:** Flutter + Dart + Firebase

**Games:** Unity + C# or Unreal + C++/Blueprints

---

## Portfolio Projects

**Mobile:**
1. Todo App
2. Weather App
3. Social App
4. Payment App (with Stripe)
5. Chat App (real-time)

**Games:**
1. 2D Platformer
2. 3D Game
3. Multiplayer Game

---

## Best Practices

- Master one platform first
- Test on real devices
- Learn native patterns first
- Optimize for performance
- Publish to app stores
