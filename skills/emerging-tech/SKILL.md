# Emerging Technologies & Leadership

## Prompt Engineering

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

```
Basic Prompting → Few-shot Learning → Chain-of-Thought → Structured Output → Optimization
```

**Techniques:**
- Clear instructions
- Role-based prompting
- Few-shot examples
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- Temperature tuning (0 = deterministic, 1 = creative)

---

## AI Agents

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks

```
LLM Fundamentals → Tool Calling → Agent Loop → Error Handling → Production Deploy
```

**Architecture:**
1. Perceive (observe state)
2. Reason (LLM decides)
3. Act (call tools)
4. Loop (repeat)

**Tools:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen

---

## AI Red Teaming

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks

**Goals:**
- Find vulnerabilities
- Identify biases
- Test safety guardrails
- Ensure alignment

**Techniques:**
- Adversarial prompting
- Jailbreak attempts
- Bias testing
- Edge case identification

---
