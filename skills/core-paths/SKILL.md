# Core Development Paths Skill

## Quick Start

This skill helps you navigate four fundamental development career paths:

1. **Frontend Development** - UI/UX, JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Vue/Angular
2. **Backend Development** - Server logic, APIs, databases, scalability
3. **Full Stack Development** - Complete application development
4. **DevOps** - Infrastructure, automation, CI/CD, containers

## Learning Path Decision Tree

```
Choose Development Path
├─ Frontend → HTML/CSS/JS → Framework (React/Vue/Angular) → State Management
├─ Backend → Language → Framework → Database → APIs
├─ Full Stack → Frontend Path + Backend Path + Integration
└─ DevOps → Linux + Docker + Kubernetes + Cloud + IaC
```

## Technology Stack Recommendations

         ↓
  Database (PostgreSQL)
         ↓
  API Routes + Authentication
         ↓
  Deployment (Vercel)
         ↓
  Monitoring & Analytics
```

### DevOps Stack (Cloud-Native)
```
Linux Fundamentals
         ↓

## How to Choose a Path

### Choose Frontend If
- You enjoy visual design and UI
- You like immediate feedback
- You're creative and detail-oriented
- You want to learn web fundamentals

### Choose Backend If
- You prefer solving complex problems
- You enjoy database design
- You like systems thinking
- You want high pay and security

### Choose Full Stack If
- You want versatility and flexibility
- You like building complete features
- You enjoy cross-domain knowledge
- You want to be a technical founder

### Choose DevOps If
- You like infrastructure and automation
- You enjoy problem-solving at scale
- You want strong job security
- You like working with diverse technologies

## Common Learning Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Jumping between technologies** - Master one thoroughly first
2. **Ignoring fundamentals** - Algorithms and data structures matter
3. **Not building projects** - Theory alone isn't enough
4. **Avoiding git/version control** - Essential for any developer
5. **Not reading code** - Learn from others' implementations
6. **Skipping testing** - Write tests from the beginning
7. **Ignoring performance** - Consider scalability early

## Time to Productivity

| Path | Entry Level | Mid Level | Senior |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Frontend | 3-6 months | 1-2 years | 3+ years |
| Backend | 6-12 months | 2-3 years | 3+ years |
| Full Stack | 1 year | 2-3 years | 3+ years |
| DevOps | 1-2 years | 2-3 years | 3+ years |

*Times vary based on prior experience and learning intensity*

## Next Steps

1. Choose ONE path to start with
2. Master the fundamentals (3-6 months)
3. Build 2-3 portfolio projects
4. Contribute to open source
5. Apply for entry-level positions
6. Continue learning and specializing
