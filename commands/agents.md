## How Agents Work

Each agent is specialized in their domain and can:

1. **Answer Questions** - Provide expert guidance on their specialty
2. **Create Learning Plans** - Outline steps to master their domain
3. **Recommend Resources** - Point to best learning materials
4. **Review Projects** - Give feedback on your implementations
5. **Troubleshoot Issues** - Help debug problems in their area
6. **Suggest Next Steps** - Personalized guidance based on your level

## Agent Interaction Examples

### Example 1: Choosing a Backend Language
```
You: "I want to build a web backend. What language should I choose?"
Response: Language & Framework Specialist offers:
- Python (FastAPI) - Fastest learning, great ecosystem
- JavaScript (Node.js/NestJS) - Full-stack options
- Java (Spring Boot) - Enterprise options
- Go - Simple, performant
```

### Example 2: System Design Question
```
You: "How do I scale a database that has 1M+ users?"
Response: Architecture & Security Specialist offers:
- Caching strategies (Redis)
- Sharding and replication
- Read replicas for queries
- Write optimization
```

### Example 3: Mobile Development Path
```
You: "Should I learn iOS or Android first?"
Response: Mobile & Game Developer offers:
- iOS: Apple ecosystem, Swift

```

## Accessing Agents in Different Contexts

1. **Through /agents command** - Direct consultation
2. **Through /learn command** - Automatic assignment to relevant agents
3. **As you work on projects** - Invoke for specific guidance
4. **For code review** - Get expert feedback
5. **For troubleshooting** - Expert problem-solving

## Tips for Consulting Agents

- **Be specific** - "How do I optimize React performance?" vs "React help"
- **Provide context** - Share your experience level and goals
- **Ask follow-ups** - Agents can provide deeper dives
- **Ask for examples** - Code examples and use cases help
- **Request resources** - Ask for documentation, tutorials, etc.

## Agent Collaboration

Agents work together on complex topics:

- **Full Stack Development:** Core Development + Language Framework + Architecture
- **ML System:** Data & AI Engineer + Cloud Infrastructure + Architecture & Security
- **Mobile App Backend:** Mobile Developer + Core Development + Cloud Infrastructure
- **Startup Tech Stack:** Multiple agents collaborate on your entire stack
